# Code Book

This is the code book for the project of Getting and Cleaning Data course. This
file describes variables used, the data used and the transformations performed
to get the tidy data.

## Variables

The variables in this dataset come from features.txt from this [dataset](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

1.  subject: The identifier used for the 30 volunteers.
    (values: 1-30)
2.  activity: The activity performed by the subject.
    * STANDING
    * SITTING
    * LAYING
    * WALKING
    * WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
    * WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3.  time.BodyAcc.mean: Mean of the time domain signals for each axis (X/Y/Z) of
                       body acceleration obtained from accelerometer
    * time.BodyAcc.mean.X
    * time.BodyAcc.mean.Y
    * time.BodyAcc.mean.Z
4.  time.BodyAcc.std: Standard deviation of the time domain signals for each
                      axis (X/Y/Z) of body acceleration obtained from accelerometer
    * time.BodyAcc.std.X
    * time.BodyAcc.std.Y
    * time.BodyAcc.std.Z
5.  time.GravityAcc.mean: Mean of the time domain signal for each axis (X/Y/Z) of
                          gravity acceleration obtained from accelerometer
    * time.GravityAcc.mean.X
    * time.GravityAcc.mean.Y
    * time.GravityAcc.mean.Z
